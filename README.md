### Inspiration
We have the desire to ensure that there is a fairuse of the U.S. government funding contributing to reforming the criminal justice system and over-incarceration to over-incarcerationin the U.S.

### What it does
Prison Break promotes change to happen, such as saving money, through data analysis.

### How we built it
Created a user inteactive website that include informative statistics. Used AI to grab data and process all information to create clear statistics.

### Challenges we ran into
Some struggles we have come across were finding recent data because it was not updated as of 2024, so we had to somewhat hardscape the data. The overall information was somewhat of a close rough estimation due to the lack of extensive information provided for current years.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating an interactive website that displays information to users. Providing statistical data that users can access and learn.

### What we learned
Learned javascript, data analysis, and how a bridge needs to be revisited.

### What's next for Prison Break
Advancing our application to be more effective and imbed the application into the website.
